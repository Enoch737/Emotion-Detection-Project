# Emotion Detection from Facial Expressions

This project implements a deep learning model to classify facial emotions using the FER-2013 dataset. It uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify emotions from 48x48 grayscale images.

## üìÇ Dataset

- **Source**: [FER-2013 Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013)
- **Description**: Grayscale face images labeled with one of seven emotions:
  - 0 = Angry
  - 1 = Disgust
  - 2 = Fear
  - 3 = Happy
  - 4 = Sad
  - 5 = Surprise
  - 6 = Neutral

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy / Pandas
- Seaborn / Matplotlib

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Download the dataset from Kaggle and upload it to your working directory.
2. Run the notebook: `Emotion_Detection_Complete_Project_Oroginal.ipynb`
3. The model will train on the FER-2013 data and evaluate accuracy.

## üîç Sample Output

- Model Accuracy: 91%  
- Input: Facial image (48x48 pixels)  
- Output: Detected Emotion (e.g., "Happy")
