# Emotion Detection Using Machine Learning

This repository contains a complete project on **Emotion Detection**, which uses machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify emotions from text data.

## üí° Project Overview

The goal of this project is to detect human emotions such as joy, anger, sadness, fear, etc., from textual input. It can be applied in real-world scenarios such as customer service automation, social media monitoring, and mental health analysis.

## üìÇ Contents
